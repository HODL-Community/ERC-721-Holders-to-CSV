To properly use this script, you must inpout the RPC URL of the desired blockchain. AVAX C-Chain RPC URL is: https://api.avax.network/ext/bc/C/rpc.

You also need the contract address and ABI, which can be found on snowtrace under the "code" section of the ERC-721 smart contract.

Simply input that data along with the amount of tokens in the collection, and run the script. It should output a CSV with all the data you're looking for.

Great for airdrops!
